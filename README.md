# IRIS-DATASET-using-TREE-

A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning,
covering both classification and regression. In decision analysis,
a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.
As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions. Though a commonly used tool in data mining for deriving a 
strategy to reach a particular goal, its also widely used in machine learning, which will be the main focus of this article.
